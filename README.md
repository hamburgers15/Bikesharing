# Bikesharing
A Tableau visualization of bikesharing data from NYC

## Overview
  
  The purpose of the project is to determine weather or not to establish a bikeshare company in Des Moines.  Using data from Citibike, I visualized how bikes were used in New York City in August of 2019.  This will allow someone to inference how bikes might be used in Des Moines.  

## Results

Using the link to the my Tableau story you will find graphs that visualize basic stats from the bikeshare indutry in NYC.

The graph below shows us that the average trip time is only 5 minutes and that almost all the trips where less then one hour.

The graph below brakes down the trip duration by gender.  We can see that most of the Citybike users are male.

The heatmap below shows us that durring the week bikes are used most offten for commuting to and from work.  The heatmap below that shows that, although men use the bikes more often, both men and women are using the bike most frequently durring the same times.

The graph below brakes down usage by both gender and user type.  It shows that 'subscribers' use the bikes more offter then 'customers'.  It also confirms the previous graphs output, with men having much higher useage rates.

Finaly, I created two maps that show the most popular start and end locations.  For both the most popular location is just outside Grand Centeral Station.


## Summary

In summary, from these visualizations we have been able to determine that male subscribers make up the majority of the bike share users, that they are mainly using the bike to commute to work and that most of the bikes are being picked up and droped off in lower Manhatten.
